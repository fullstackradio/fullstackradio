In this episode, Adam talks with [Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool) about Behavior Driven Development and Domain Driven Design. They talk about how you can use these ideas to better understand your clients' needs and to build software that closely models their business. They also talk about where these ideas don't work so well, and some of the challenges and trade-offs you face when trying to build software this way.
