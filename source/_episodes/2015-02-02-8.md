In this episode, Adam talks with [Sean Devine](https://twitter.com/barelyknown), host of the Ruby on Rails podcast. Sean gives Adam an introduction to building applications with Ember, and how it's different than the way you might sprinkle AngularJS into a mostly server-side app. They talk about why your Ember apps shouldn't be mixed in with your server-side code, and the advantages that come along with building a server-side API with no front end of it's own.
