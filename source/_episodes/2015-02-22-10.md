In this episode, Adam talks with [Ryan Tablada](https://twitter.com/RyanTablada) and [Matt Machuga](https://twitter.com/machuga) about the philosophical differences between programming in a statically typed language vs. a dynamically typed language. They talk about things like explicit interfaces vs. duck typing, function calling vs. message passing, and some of the recent RFCs around optional typing in the PHP community.
