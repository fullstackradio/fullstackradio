In this episode, Adam talks with [Matt Machuga](https://twitter.com/machuga) of [Think Through Math](http://www.thinkthroughmath.com/) about being a Rubyist who still writes PHP and the differences between writing PHP like a Rubyist vs. writing PHP like a Java developer. They also talk about common struggles when learning new things, and trying to remain pragmatic while still pushing the boundaries of what you know.
